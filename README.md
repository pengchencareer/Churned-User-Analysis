# Churned-User-Analysis

Churn user analysis has become more and more popular in tech companies for these years, which is to analyze which users are churned, when they are churned and why they are churned. The purpose of doing churn user analysis is to help retain existing users for companies, which is considered less expensive than acquiring new users from business perspective.

This project has been through 3 main components with dataset from an investing company:
1. Define churned user.
2. Build a model to predict which user will churn.
3. Find out the most important features.

This project is still underway and is targeted to be completed at the end of the March.
